# Firebird REST API

A RESTful API service that provides access to Firebird databases through HTTP endpoints. This project allows you to interact with your Firebird database using standard REST API calls.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd firebird-restapi
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env as needed
npm run dev
```

---

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Secure database access via environment variables
- **High-performance Firebird connection pooling (pool size 5)**
- Centralized SQL query templates
- CORS support
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Consistent date formatting
- Docker support for containerized deployment

## Architecture

- **Connection Pooling:** All Firebird database access uses connection pooling (pool size 5) via `node-firebird`.
- **Centralized SQL Templates:** All SQL queries are defined in `services/sqlQueries.js`.
- **Standardized Error Handling:** All routes use a centralized logger (`winston`).
- **Consistent Date Formatting:** Handled by `convertToLocalTime` in `utils/koreanUtils.js`.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Firebird 2.5 or higher
- Windows OS
- Docker (optional)

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```
PORT=3000
FIREBIRD_HOST=host.docker.internal
FIREBIRD_PORT=3050
FIREBIRD_DATABASE=C:\path\to\your\database.FDB
FIREBIRD_USER=your_username
FIREBIRD_PASSWORD=your_password
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the server in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Start the server in development mode with auto-reload

---

## Deployment

- Use `deploy.bat` for Windows deployment.
- For Docker, see below.

---

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t firebird-restapi .
docker run --name fbapi -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env firebird-restapi
```

---

## API Endpoints

See the [API Endpoints section above](#api-endpoints) for details on `/api/persons` and other routes.

---

## Error Handling

- Standardized error responses with HTTP status codes.
- See the Error Responses section for format and codes.

---

## Security

- Uses environment variables for sensitive info.
- CORS is restricted to allowed origins.
- Input validation and sanitization.

---

## Logging

- Uses Winston for logging.
- Logs stored in `logs/` directory.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Firebird is running and accessible.
- Check `.env` configuration.
- Review logs in `logs/` for errors.

## Windows Service Setup with Ngrok Tunnel

The API can be installed as a Windows service that automatically starts on system boot and provides external access via ngrok tunnel.

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have administrator privileges
- Node.js must be installed globally

### Ngrok Configuration
The service is configured with a custom domain and authentication:
- Custom Domain: `prompt-liberal-vulture.ngrok-free.app`
- Authentication: Configured with secure token
- Region: US
- Port: 3000 (default)

### Installation Steps

1. Install the service:
```bash
node install-service.js
```

2. The service will automatically:
   - Start the REST API server
   - Create an ngrok tunnel with the custom domain
   - Establish a secure connection using the configured auth token

### Managing the Service

- The service will automatically start on system boot
- You can manage the service through Windows Services (services.msc)
- Service name: "Firebird REST API"
- To uninstall the service:
```bash
node install-service.js uninstall
```

### Accessing the API

- Main API endpoint: `https://prompt-liberal-vulture.ngrok-free.app`
- The tunnel is persistent and will always use this domain
- The service automatically re-establishes the tunnel if disconnected

### Accessing the Logs

- Service logs can be found in the Windows Event Viewer
- Look for "Firebird REST API" in the Windows Logs > Application section
- Ngrok connection status is logged on service startup

### Notes

- The custom domain ensures a consistent URL across service restarts
- The service uses authenticated ngrok connections for enhanced security
- The service will automatically restart if it crashes (up to 3 times)
- All connections are secured via HTTPS by default
